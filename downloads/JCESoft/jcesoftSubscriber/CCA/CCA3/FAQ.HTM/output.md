>  YES! The biggest change in Volume 3 is the use of a new video compression methods for movies. This was done because the older method (Intel Indeo 3.2) used for the video on Chemistry Comes Alive! Volumes 1 and 2 is not compatible with QuickTime 3 for Windows 98/95, and because the new method (Sorenson)produces much higher quality video with significantly smaller movie files. QuickTime 3 or higher is required to view the Sorensen video on this CD.

>  Volume 3, like Volume 2, includes full screen (640x480) versions of the still images.However, versions of these images of smaller size are not included. The large images are the most useful (such as for showing in the classroom, or for "taking a closer look") and they can easily be resized to smaller sizes.

>  Besides containing text and movie links, the "topics" pages also contain still images/pictures. Examples of these pictures include the first, last and some intermediate frames of every movie, as well as related charts and exhibits. Each picture is linked to a larger version of the picture.  (Note that this differs slightly from the process in Volume 2

>  .)  You might want to use the larger version to display to a class, or simply to get a better look at the image.

These movies are really just sequences of JPEG compressed stills put together to make it convenient for you to quickly step through and pick out the images you are interested in. You should use the frame stepping buttons to move through this movie,

> | --- | --- | --- |
> |  | INDEX.HTM | This is the  **entry page**   . The user begins here. |
> |  | CONTENTS.HTM | This is the  **table of contents**   page. This page provides links to the various topics, which are organized within four chapters generally aligned with the general chemistry curriculum. The pages themselves are contained in the folder MAIN. |
> |  | WORDS.HTM | This is the  **index**   page. This page is a list of words. Each word links to information in pages in the folder named INDEX. |
> |  | BOOKS.HTM | This is the  **textbook cross reference**   page. This page is a list of general chemistry textbooks. Each one links to a page that contains a list of chapters in the textbook. These pages are contained in the folder named BOOKS. |
> |  | MATRIX.HTM | This is a  **list of topics**   , an alternative table of contents reflecting the fact that many of the topics are related to multiple chapters. In this list a topic appears only once. Thus this page can be seen as a canonical list of the topics. Another feature of this page is that for each topic there is a link to the topic's first movie. One can get to this page via the entry page and the table of contents page.    The  **topic**   pages themselves are contained in the folder MAIN. |

> |  | FAQ.HTM | This is the page you are now viewing, with answers to frequently asked questions. All pages link to here via the "Frequently Asked Questions" text button at the bottom of the page. You can get to this page from the entry page. |
> |  | LICENSE.HTM | This page contains licensing information. |
> |  | WEB.HTM | This page provides a warning message "You must be online..." and the link to the Chemistry Comes Alive! web site. You can get to this page from the entry page. |
> |  | README.HTM | This page contains installation related information. You can get to this page from the entry page. |
> |  |  |  |
> |  |  | Folders that contain files |
> |  | BOOKS | There is a file here for each textbook. You get to these files from the textbook cross reference page BOOKS.HTM when you pick a textbook. |
> |  | BOOKDATA | For each textbook there is a file here  which provides the initial raw data assigning our keywords to locations in the textbook. This information was used to construct the textbook cross reference.  By providing this information we hope to receive feedback which can be used to  improve future versions of Chemistry Comes Alive!. |
> |  | GRAPHICS | This file contains widely used graphic images. |
> |  |  |  |
> |  |  | Folders that contain folders |
> |  |  | (Each of the contained folders is associated with a topic.) |
> |  | MAIN | In here are the main topics. There is one folder per topic. In each of these folders is the entry page (PAGE1.HTM), safety information (SAFETY.HTM), and credits (CREDnnn.HTM) for the topic. |
> |  | MOVIES | These are the movies for each topic. These movies are viewed via the movie player pages in MVHTM. |
> |  | MVHTM | These are the movie player pages. There is one HTML page per movie. These pages show the movies in MOVIES and provide additional information, like where the movie is located and the voice-over text. |
> |  | STILLS | These are the still images, organized by topic. Within each folder for a topic is located folders for different sized images. These images are displayed by the pages in STHTM. Also located here are the  still image reference movies. |
> |  | STHTM | Here there is one page per "still image reference movie". These pages show these movies (which are in STILLS) and provide links to the still images. |
