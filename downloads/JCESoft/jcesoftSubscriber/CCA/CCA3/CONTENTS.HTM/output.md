|  | | The topics on Chemistry Comes Alive!" Volume 3 are arranged within 4 chapters. The chapters are: | | | --- | --- | |  | [**Enthlapy/Thermodynamics**](#ENTH)    [**Oxidation/Reduction Reactions**](#ORRX)    [**Oxidation/Reduction Aqueous Solutions**](#ORAS)    [**Electrochemistry**](#ELEC) | | Some of the topics fall into multiple chapters. For example, the Reaction of Chlorine with Aluminum demonstration can be used to illustrate concepts relating to Enthlapy/Thermodynamics as well as concepts relating to Oxidation/Reduction Reactions. An asterisk indicates that the topic occurs within multiple chapters. | | |
