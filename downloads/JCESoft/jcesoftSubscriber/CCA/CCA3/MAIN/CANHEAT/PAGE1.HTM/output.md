>  Ethanol is poured into a saturated calcium acetate solution. A precipitate rapidly forms as the solubility of the calcium acetate is reduced. Liquid is trapped in the network of solid calcium acetate, forming a gel. When ignited, the alcohol in the gel burns. Similar gels are used as a source of fuel in portable cooking stoves.

> 
>  This demonstration shows how a solid (or semisolid) fuel can be made that is easier to handle and safer than the original liquid ethanol fuel. Practical application in portable stoves is mentioned.
