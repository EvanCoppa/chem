>  Each of the videos in this section shows the reaction (or absence of reaction) when a sample of a metal is placed into a solution containing a metal ion. By viewing the videos students can determine which metal ion is the strongest oxidizing agent and which metal is the strongest reducing agent. The videos could be used in homework or quiz questions that ask students to rank the metals in order of reducing strength or to rank the metal ions in order of oxidizing strength.

When metals react with copper(II) nitrate solutions, gas bubbles form on the surface of the metal (in addition to the layer of copper that forms) and the color of the solution changes from blue to green. If these solutions are allowed to stand overnight, the blue color returns to the liquid phase and a white or bluish-white precipitate forms. These observations are not made when a solution of copper(II) sulfate reacts with the same metals.

>  The gas that forms is colorless. It might be nitrogen monoxide or it might be hydrogen. Nitrogen monoxide could be formed by reduction of nitrate ions, and hydrogen could be formed by reaction of zinc with an acidic solution. (Electrode potentials do not predict that hydrogen should be formed by reaction of a neutral aqueous solution with any of the metals, but solutions of copper(II) ions are somewhat acidic.) The rather greenish-blue color formed after zinc, cadmium, and lead have reacted with copper(II) nitrate may be due to formation of nitro complexes of copper(II) from nitrite ions that result from reduction of nitrate. (The same color is formed when sodium nitrite is added to copper(II) sulfate solution.) Formation of nitrite ions argues for NO as the gas that is formed. NO can be formed by reduction of nitrate and is easily air oxidized to NO

>  2. When a piece of nickel metal is dipped in a lead(II) nitrate solution, no reaction is observed. When a piece of nickel is dipped in a copper(II) nitrate solution, copper crystals are deposited. From your observations and the information provided in this question, determine whether a reaction will occur when nickel is dipped in solutions of zinc nitrate, cadmium nitrate, or silver nitrate. [Possible answers: Crystals will form; no reaction will take place; it is impossible to determine whether a reaction will take place from the information provided.]
