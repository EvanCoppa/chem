>  The presence of copper ions can be observed by adding each solution to a dilute solution of ammonia. If copper ions were present, we would see the blue color of the copper-ammonia complex. Sulfuric acid has oxidized the copper metal, as indicated by the blue color. Nitric acid is a stronger oxidizing agent (and produces a higher concentration of copper(II) ions), as indicated by the darker blue color.

>  Of the four industrially important strong acids, only two, nitric and sulfuric, are strong enough oxidizing agents to dissolve copper. The concentration of copper(II) ions is larger with the nitric acid, because it is a stronger oxidizing agent than sulfuric acid. This is demonstrated by reaction the copper(II) ions with ammoniato form the deep blue copper-ammonia complex ion.
