>  Concentrated nitric acid is a strong acid and a strongly oxidizing acid. It reacts violently with strong reducing agents such as alcohol or turpentine. Ingestion causes burning and corrosion of internal tissues. If spilled on the skin concentrated nitric acid should be washed off immediately with a large quantity of water.

>  Nitrogen dioxide forms acid on contact with moisture and is a poisonous, choking gas. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide may cause only slight pain or even pass unnoticed, but several days later may result in edema and cause death. 100 ppm is dangerous for even a short exposure and 200 ppm can cause death. This reaction should only be done with proper ventilation.

>  Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and a strong dehydrating agent and can burn the skin. Dissolving concentrated sulfuric acid in water is highly exothermic. Concentrated sulfuric acid should always be poured into water, not water into the acid.

> 
>  Sulfur dioxide is generated in this process and so the demonstration should only be done when there is adequate ventilation. Sulfur dioxide is toxic and a strong irritant with a powerful, choking odor.

>  Hydrochloric acid can cause severe burns and permanent blindness. If ingested it burns mucous membranes and can cause circulatory collapse and death.

>  Hydrogen chloride gas is given off by hot concentrated hydrochloric acid. It causes inflammation and ulceration of the respiratory tract. Heating concentrated hydrochloric acid should only be done with good ventilation.
