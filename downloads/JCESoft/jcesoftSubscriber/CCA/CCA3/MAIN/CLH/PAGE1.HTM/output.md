>  Hydrogen gas from a storage tank is ignited in air.When the hydrogen flame is lowered into chlorine gas in a glass cylinder, the flame becomes larger and brighter, indicating that the hydrogen is now being oxidized by chlorine instead of oxygen. The product of the reaction of hydrogen and chlorine is hydrogen chloride. The presence of hydrogen chloride is demonstrated by bringing the stopper from a bottle of aqueous ammonia above the glass cylinder. A smoke of ammonium chloride forms.

>  Hydrogen gas flowing from a capillary is ignited. The watch glass covering a glass cylinder of chlorine is removed and the hydrogen flame lowered into the chlorine. The reaction between hydrogen and air is replaced by the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine, which produces hydrogen chloride. As the flame burns the level of chlorine gas in the container decreases. When a stopper from a bottle of aqueous ammonia is brought near the flame, white fumes of ammonium chloride are produced indicating the presence of hydrogen chloride.

>  Hydrogen gas and chlorine do not react at room temperature, just as hydrogen gas and air do not react. If the hydrogen is ignited in air, the increase in temperature due to the exothermic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen allows the reaction to proceed at a fast rate and a flame appears. The hydrogen flame in air is nearly invisible. Once ignited in air the hydrogen flame can be moved to an atmosphere that consists of mainly chlorine. Then the chlorine takes over as the oxidizing agent. The flame becomes much more visible and appears larger. A chemical reaction continues, but the flame temperature and reaction products are different.
