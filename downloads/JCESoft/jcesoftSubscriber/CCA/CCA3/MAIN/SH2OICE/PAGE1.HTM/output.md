>  Dissolving sulfuric acid in water is an exothermic process. When sulfuric acid is mixed with ice this exothermic process causes the temperature to rise at first, but as more of the ice melts, the temperature falls. Because a sulfuric acid solution has a lower freezing point than water, the temperature can fall below 0 degrees Celsiusif enough ice is present.

>  2. Explain why the temperature eventually falls below 0 degrees Celsius in this experiment.

>  3. How could you change the conditions of the experiment so that the temperature would first rise and then fall, but would never fall below 0 degrees Celsius?
