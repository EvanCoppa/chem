>  By separating the strong oxidizer (potassium chlorate) from the reducer (phosphorus)the matches are prevented from igniting spontaneously.Unlike the safety matches shown here, strike-anywhere matches are made with oxidizer and reducer together in the match head so that only friction or elevated temperature is required to ignite them.
