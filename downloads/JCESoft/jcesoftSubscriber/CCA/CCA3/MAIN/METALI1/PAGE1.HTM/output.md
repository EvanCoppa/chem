>  When a small quantity of powdered aluminum is mixed with some iodine crystals and a few drops of water are added, a vigorous reaction ensues, producing purple iodine vapor and flame. Aluminum iodide is the product. Similar reactions occur when the aluminum is replaced by manganese, zinc, and iron, but nickel is shown not to react with iodine under the same conditions. A graphic shows each reaction and the electrode potential of each metal/metal-ion couple.

>  Powdered aluminum and powdered iodine are mixed together and then one or two drops of water are added to the mixture. Shortly after the water is added, a vigorous reaction occurs. There is flame and lots of iodine vapor given off. Some of the iodine vapor can be seen to be reacting to form some other substance because the color is no longer violet but kind of a reddish brown. This vigorous reaction shows that aluminum metal is a fairly strong reducing agent and iodine solid is a fairly strong oxidizing agent.

>  Manganese is mixed with iodine. Notice that the powdered manganeseis black, and the iodine is also nearly black. Again there is noreaction just upon mixing the solid materials but as soon as a fewdrops of water are added, a reaction does take place. Again thereaction is vigorous, but this time there is no flame. By comparisonwith the aluminum reaction, the manganese reaction was not asvigorous.

In this case, adding waterinitiates a reaction but it is not as vigorous as the reaction of thealuminum or the manganese. Apparently iron is not as strong areducing agent as these other metals relative to iodine.

>  Granular zinc is mixed with iodine and there is no reaction whenthe two dry solids are mixed together. When water is added to thismixture, there is a reaction approximately as vigorous as thereaction of the manganese with the iodine, showing that zinc andmanganese are roughly equivalent in reducing strength, and arestronger than iron and nickel, but not quite as strong as aluminum.

>  The role of water in initiating these reactions is not completely clear. Water may serve as a reaction medium, or it may remove soluble metal iodides from metal surfaces, serving to increase the rates of reactions.

>  Reduction potentials and oxidation potentials refer to reactions in aqueous solutionsat standard concentrations and therefore do not strictly apply to the reactions shown here.Nevertheless, standard potentials give a rough indication of oxidizing and reducing power,and they correlate reasonably well with reactivity as observed in the videos.
