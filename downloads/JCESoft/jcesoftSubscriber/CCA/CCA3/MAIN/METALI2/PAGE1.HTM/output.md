>  An electrochemical cell with zinc metal dipping in zinc sulfate and a graphite electrode dipping in a porous cup containing iodine and aqueous potassium iodide is assembled. When the porous cup is placed in the zinc sulfate solution and the electrodes are connected to a motor, the motor turns the hand on a clock. When the zinc/zinc sulfate half-cell is replaced with aluminum/aluminum sulfate, the motor turns slowly. When the oxide coat on the metal is removed by sanding, the motor initially speeds up, but then slows down once again as more oxide builds up.

>  A zinc strip is placed in a zinc sulfate solution. Iodine and potassium iodide are mixed in a porous cup. Placing the cup in the zinc solution, putting a graphite electrode connected to a motor in the solution, and connecting the zinc metal to the other side of the motor completes the circuit, allowing electricity to flow and driving the motor.

However, the presence of a hard, impenetrable oxide coat makes the aluminum less reactive than would be expected. It is this same oxide coat that protects aluminum from the rapid corrosion that is such a problem for metals such as iron.
