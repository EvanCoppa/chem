>  Iron(II) sulfide and zinc sulfide are quite stable compounds and their formation from the metal and sulfur is highly exothermic. However, iron and sulfur and zinc and sulfur can be mixed at room temperature and no reaction takes place. Only when heated to the temperature of a red-hot metal rod do they react rapidly-in the case of zinc, almost explosively.
