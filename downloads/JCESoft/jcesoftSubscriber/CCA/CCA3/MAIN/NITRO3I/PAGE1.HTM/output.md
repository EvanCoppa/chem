>  A ringstand is set up with two rings, each holding a filter paper on which nitrogen triiodide has been spread. The bottom filter paper is touched with a feather, causing an explosion that detonates the other sample of nitrogen triiodide. The equation for the reaction is given.

>  When nitrogen triiodide, the dark colored solid, is dry, it is very sensitive to touch or any vibration. Simply touching it with a feather causes it to explode or detonate. One detonation causes another to occur. One product of the reaction is violet iodine vapor.
