>  A buffered luminol solution with a copper(II) catalyst is added tothe funnel on the left. A hydrogen peroxide solution is added to thefunnel on the right. On releasing the rubber tubing the solutionsmix. The chemical reaction generates energy which is seen as bluelight. This process is chemiluminescence. When the reactingsolution mixes with a dye, fluorescein, the light energy from thereaction causes the fluorescein to give off a greenish light in aprocess called fluorescence.

>  Commercially available light sticks contain a solution in a glass vial. When the vial is broken, a second solution mixes with the first and light is generated.Different dyes give off different colors when they are caused to fluoresce by the lightof the chemiluminescent reaction. Light sticks give off light from 3to 8 hours, depending on the concentrations of reactants.

>  In the luminol demonstration two solutions are mixed. They react, producing blue light.In a light stick one solution is in a flexible plastic tube. The other solution is in a thin-walled glass vial inside the plastic tube. When the glass vial is broken the solutions mix and light is given off.By adding fluorescent dyes and/or changing the color of the plastic tubethe color of the light stick can be adjusted.
