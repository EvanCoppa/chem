>  Because of its high reactivity, potassium metal is stored in mineral oil, a relatively inert liquid. The protective coating of mineral oil must be removed from the metal's surface. The soft potassium will then be cut, and a small piece will be picked up with forceps and carefully added to a small beaker of liquid bromine. The large covered beaker prevents the escape of bromine vapor and reaction products into the environment.

>  This is a very dangerous reaction, but it provides a nice illustration of what happens when a strong reducing agent and a strong oxidizing agent are brought together. It also illustrates formation of an ionic compound. A great deal of energy can be given off when an electron is transferred from atom that can lose an electron easily to an atom that can gain an electron easily and an ionic crystal lattice is formed.
