>  Magnesium is placed in a cavity in a block of dry ice. Themagnesium is ignited and covered by another block of dry ice. Despite the absence of air, the magnesium continues to glow, due toits reaction with carbon dioxide. Because of this reaction, carbondioxide cannot be used to extinguish magnesium fires.

>  This is a very striking demonstration of the strong reducing strength of magnesium and the very great stability of magnesium oxide. One might expect that the low temperature of the dry ice would prevent reaction by slowing it down. The relative stability of carbon dioxide also would argue against reaction. But the reaction is exothermic and the temperature rapidly increases to where it goes quite rapidly.
