>  A Cheeto is shown to undergo rapid oxidation when placed in a small quantity of molten potassium chlorate, as evidenced by smoke, flames, and noise. The nutrition information for the Cheeto is shown. When a piece of celery, similar in size to the Cheeto, is dropped into an equal quantity of potassium chlorate, gentle bubbling occurs, indicating slow oxidation, and less energy released.

>  Items of food contain considerable energy. Under appropriate conditions this energy can be released much more rapidly than it is in your body. To release the energy rapidly, a sample of potassium chlorate is melted with a burner and a piece of food is dropped into the molten potassium chlorate. The food reacts fairly violently in an exothermic process that releases considerable energy.

>  Here is a Cheeto. According to the nutrition information on the package, 21 Cheetos provide 150 nutritional Calories. One nutritional Calorie is one kilocalorie, so each Cheeto can release about seven kilocalories or 30 kJ of energy. When a Cheeto is placed into liquid potassium chlorate the vigorous, highly exothermic reaction releases about 30 kJ.

>  When a piece of celery is placed into a test tube containing molten potassium chlorate the celery reacts vigorously, but much less than a Cheeto does because there are fewer Calories in a piece of celery than there are in a Cheeto. This demonstration indicates how much energy is available from oxidation of foods.
