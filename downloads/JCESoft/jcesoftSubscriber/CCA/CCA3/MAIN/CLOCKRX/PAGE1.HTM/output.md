>  A solution of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid is added to a solution containing iodide ion, thiosulfate ion, and starch. After some time the dark blue color of a triiodide-starch complex is observed. The influences of initial reactant concentrations on the reaction time are examined, as are the influence of volume and temperature.

>  A solution of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid is added to a solution of iodide ion, thiosulfate ion, and starch. A slow reaction forms triiodide, which reacts rapidly with thiosulfate, until the thiosulfate is consumed. The excess triiodide then reacts with the starch to form a blue complex.

>  In the experiment testing the influence of volume on reaction rate, the color changes in the four vials do not occur at the same instant, because not all four solutions were mixed at exactly the same time. The important point is that the color changes were nearly simultaneous, especially compared to the overall time for the reaction. As long as the concentrations are the same, solution volume should not affect the rate of reaction.
