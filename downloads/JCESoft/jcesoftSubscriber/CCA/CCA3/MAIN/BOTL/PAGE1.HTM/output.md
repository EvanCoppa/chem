>  Color changes are caused by reactions of oxygen in the air with chemicals in a solution. The colors fade over time, but can be regenerated by shaking the flask containing the solution.

>  Methylene blue indicator solution is added to a solution containing dextrose and potassium hydroxide. When the solution is shaken, it becomes intensely blue. The color fades after several seconds, but can be re-established by shaking. This process can be repeated several times although the color changes after many shakes.

>  Methylene blue indicator is added to a pink solution of resazurin, dextrose and potassium hydroxide. When the solution is shaken it becomes intensely blue. After a short time the blue color fades yielding a pink solution which then fades to clear. Shaking the solution re-establishes the blue color.

>  If the solution is allowed to stand, methylene blue is reduced by dextrose to a colorless form. When the flask is shaken, oxygen dissolves from the air, oxidizing the methylene blue back to its blue form.

>  Resazurin is irreversibly reduced by dextrose to a fluorescent red that is reversibly reduced to a colorless form. The colorless compound is readily oxidized back to the red form. More vigorous shaking dissolves enough oxygen to also oxidize the methylene blue.
