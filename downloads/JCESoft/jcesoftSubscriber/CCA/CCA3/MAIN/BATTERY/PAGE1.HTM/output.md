Lead(IV) oxide is reduced to lead(II) sulfate at one electrode, and lead metal is oxidized to lead(II) sulfate at the other. These are the same chemical reactions that provide electrical energy in a lead storage battery.

>  When a lead storage battery discharges, lead(II) sulfate forms on both electrodes. When the battery is recharged, the above half-reactions are reversed. However, a new lead storage battery has lead(II) oxide on one electrode and pure lead for the other, which is quite different from starting with two lead electrodes as in this demonstration.

Indeed, the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from sulfuric acid rather than lead and lead(IV) oxide from lead(II) sulfate is highly undesirable in a real battery. If a lead storage battery is overcharged, hydrogen and oxygen can be generated. They can form an explosive mixture in or near the battery, and that mixture can be ignited by a spark, cigaret, or match. When you recharge a battery or jump-start a car, the last connection in the circuit should be made far away from the battery. This lessens the probability of an explosion.
