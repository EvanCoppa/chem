> ### Discussion
> 
> 
> 
> 
>  This series of movies can be used to allow students to discover the order of oxidizing ability of the halogens. Students could be asked to select a reaction and that reaction could be shown. Based on whether there is a color change, students could whether each of the possible reactions takes place, thereby showing that chlorine reacts with bromide and iodide, bromine reacts with iodide, and iodine does not react with either of the other halide ions.
