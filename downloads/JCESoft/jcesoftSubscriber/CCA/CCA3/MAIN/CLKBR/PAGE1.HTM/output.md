>  A test tube contains a layer of potassium bromide solution over a denser layer of carbon tetrachloride. Chlorine is bubbled through the potassium bromide layer. The chlorine reacts with the bromide to form bromine. The aqueous layer contains a mixture of bromine, bromide ion and tribromide ion. Bromine is also dissolved in the carbon tetrachloride layer to form a reddish solution. The bromide and tribromide ions do not dissolve in the carbon tetrachloride and remain in the aqueous layer. Some bromine gas can be seen above the aqueous layer. After some time the stream of chlorine has swept all of the bromine from the aqueous solution into the gas phase.Some bromine remains in the carbon tetrachloride layer.

>  This demonstration illustrates that chlorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than bromine, since bromide is oxidized by chlorine to bromine. Only one interhalogen compound of bromine and chlorine can be formed, namely BrCl. It is a red-brown gas. Decolorization of the solution probably occurs when all of the bromine and bromine monochloride have been swept out of the solution by the steam of chlorine.
