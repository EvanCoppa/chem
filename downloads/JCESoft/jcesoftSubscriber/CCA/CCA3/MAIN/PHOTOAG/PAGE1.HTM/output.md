>  Silver nitrate solution is poured into a dish containing a pieceof filter paper. When sodium chloride solution is added, the paperbecomes coated with a layer of solid silver chloride. The paper ismoved to another dish, and a key is placed on top of it. When thepaper is exposed to the light from a burning magnesium ribbon, thepaper darkens due to photodecomposition of the silver chloride, whichproduces silver metal. Removing the key reveals its image on thepaper.

>  This video demonstrates how photographic film can capture an image. Silver halides can be reduced to metallic silver by light as shown here. When film is exposed to light, each exposed silver halide crystal has a few atoms of silver in it, while unexposed crystals have none. Photographic developer reduces the rest of the silver halide in the exposed crystals, because the reduction occurs faster when there are already silver atoms present. Then a fixer is used to dissolve away the rest of the (unexposed) silver halide. This leaves a negative image--dark where the film has been exposed to light and colorless where it has not been exposed. The processes involved are described in detail in Jacob, A. T., "The Chemistry of Black & White Photography,", Institute for Chemical Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1101 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706-1396.
