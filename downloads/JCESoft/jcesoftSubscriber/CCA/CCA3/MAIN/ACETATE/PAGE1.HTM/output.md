>  A supersaturated solution of sodium acetate is poured onto onesmall sodium acetate crystal. Crystals form from the liquid immediatelyupon contact with the seed crystal. A thermometer shows that thecrystallization process is exothermic. A chemical hot pack isshown as an example of a commercially available supersaturatedsolution.

>  A solution of sodium acetate in water is in a flask. A fewsmall crystals of sodium acetate are placed on the top of thelaboratory bench. The solution from the flask is poured over thecrystals. As the solution contacts the crystals, its color changesfrom clear to white very rapidly and it crystallizes into a solidmound of material that builds up into a fairly tall verticalstructure.

>  The probe from a digital thermometer touches the solidsodium acetate to test the temperature. It is seen that thematerial is quite warm. The process of crystallization is anexothermic process in which heat is given off to the surroundings.The crystallization occurred rapidly once a seed crystal wasavailable. The seed crystal provides a structure around which theions of sodium acetate could form a solid crystal lattice.

>  Now a commercial application of this crystallization process isshown. A metal disc is manipulated inside a sealed plastic bagholding the sodium acetate solution. This causes the sodiumacetate to crystallize. The digital thermometer shows that thetemperature of the heating pack has gone up significantly fromroom temperature. This heating pack provides an easily portablemethod of having heat available whenever and wherever it isneeded.

>  Without a seed crystal to act as a template for formation of a crystal lattice, crystallization is very slowand a solution can be supersaturated for a long time. Because this crystallization process is exothermicit has practical application as a heating pad.
