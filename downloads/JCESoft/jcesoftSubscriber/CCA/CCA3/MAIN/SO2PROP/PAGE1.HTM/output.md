>  When purple permanganate solution is poured into sulfur dioxide, the permanganate is reduced to nearly colorless manganese(II) ions, and the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfate ion. When dichromate solution is added to this colorless solution, the sulfur dioxide reduces the yellow dichromate to green chromium(III) ion, while the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfate ion.

>  A large beaker contains a covered vial of soda lime, which is a damp mixture of sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide. Sulfur dioxide gas is added to the beaker and the top of the beaker is sealed with a rubber dam. The vial is tipped over, so the soda lime can mix with the sulfur dioxide. The reaction of the calcium oxide with sulfur dioxide creates solid calcium sulfite, decreasing the number of gas particles and thus the pressure within the beaker, so the dam is pushed inward by atmospheric pressure.

>  Sulfur dioxide is a good bleaching agent and is used for that purpose industrially. It is also a good reducing agent, which accounts for its decolorizing permanganate solutions and for changing the color of chromate solutions. Sulfur dioxide is generated on a large scale by combustion of sulfur in coal at electric power plants and other industrial sites. One way to remove sulfur dioxide from stack gases at such plants is to use calcium oxide, as demonstrated here.
