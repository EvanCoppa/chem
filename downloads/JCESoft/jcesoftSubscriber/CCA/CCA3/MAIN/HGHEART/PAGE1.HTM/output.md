>  The dichromate oxidizes the mercury to mercury(I) ions, which combine with sulfate ions at the surface of the mercury drop to form a film of insoluble mercury(I) sulfate. This film decreases the surface tension of the mercury, allowing the drop to flatten. Eventually the mercury drop expands to touch the iron nail, at which time electrons flow from the nail to the mercury. The electrons reduce the mercury(I) ions to mercury, destroying the surface film. The surface tension increases and the mercury drop becomes more spherical, pulling back from the nail. When the mercury and the iron nail no longer touch, mercury(I) sulfate again builds up on the surface, and the process repeats.

>  The mercury drop, iron nail, and aqueous solution of acidic dichromate constitute a galvanic cell in which the mercury serves as the cathode and the iron serves as the anode. There is a voltage difference between the iron and mercury electrodes. During the time when there is no electrical connection between the mercury and the iron, dichromate oxidizes Hg(
>  *l* 
>  ) to Hg
>  2 
>  SO
>  4 
>  (
>  *s* 
>  ), which forms a layer on the mercury surface. This surface layer reduces the surface tension of the liquid mercury, allowing the mercury drop to flatten. Eventually the mercury contacts the iron nail and the cell is short circuited. Transfer of electrons from the iron to the mercury and thence to the Hg

>  *s*

>  2 
>  SO
>  4 
>  (
>  *s* 
>  ) back to metallic mercury. This increases the surface tension of the mercury and the drop becomes rounder, causing it to recede from the nail and break the circuit. Then the surface film builds up again as a result of oxidation of mercury by the dichromate.

>  This reaction can occur more rapidly when mediated by the oxidation and reduction of mercury, presumably because a surface coating of hydroxide or oxide on the iron slows the metal's reaction with dichromate ions and hydrogen ions in the aqueous solution. Some of the Gibbs free energy released by this overall reaction serves to drive the physical movement of the mercury drop.
