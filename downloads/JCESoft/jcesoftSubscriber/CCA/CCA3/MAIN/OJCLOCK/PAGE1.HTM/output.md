> 
> 
>  1. Make a diagram of the galvanic cell that powers the orange juice clock. Label the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte solution. Show the direction of electron travel in the circuit.
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  2. Speculate on what would happen to the clock if the connections at the back were reversed. That is, suppose the red and black wires were interchanged. How could you check this if you had a clock but no orange juice and magnesium?
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  3. What is the approximate voltage generated by the orange juice clock? (Assume that the reactions take place at standard concentrations of metal ions.)
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  4. From your observations of the orange juice clock hooked to a chart recorder, describe how the voltage varies over time. (High voltages drive the chart pen to the left side of the chart.)
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  5. When the voltage is measured as a function of time, the highest voltage occurs immediately after the electrodes are immersed in the orange juice. The voltage drops each time the clock ticks, and when the voltage builds up again, it does not reach as high a value as it did at first. Explain why the voltage drops each time the clock ticks and why it does not build up to as high a value after the electrodes have been immersed for a while.
