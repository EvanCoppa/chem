F.,Mexico</P><P>The Orange Juice Clock, in which a galvanic cell is made from thecombination of a magnesium strip, a copper strip, and juice in abeaker, has been a popular classroom, conference, and workshopdemonstration for nearly 10 years. It is widely enjoyed because itshows visually how chemistry - or more precisely, electrochemistry -is responsible for the very common phenomenon of a clock ticking. Thechemistry of the process can also be understood on a variety oflevels, from middle school (simple electron flow in a circuit, Ohm'slaw) and high school (reduction/oxidation and standard cellpotentials) to first-year college (cell potential at nonidealconditions) and graduate school courses (overpotential and chargetransfer across interfaces.) The discussion that follows considersthe recent history, chemistry, and educational uses of thedemonstration.</P><P><B>The History</B></P><P>The demonstration was devised by one of us (PK) in 1986, afterreading an activity in Hubert Alyea's 1947 compendium of chemicaldemonstrations from this<I> Journal</I> (<I>1</I>). In that activity,Alyea hooked a magnesium strip to the negative battery terminal of anelectric bell and hooked a copper strip to the positive terminal. Heplaced the loose ends of the strips into a 1MH<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> solution and the bell rang. After tryingthe demonstration, it seemed to make sense to modify the electrolyteto orange juice because it is safe, readily available, and would be amixture in which the magnesium would oxidize more slowly than insulfuric acid. Further, a clock was substituted for the bell becausea clock is easier on the ears than a bell. A video of theorange-juice clock setup is given as Figure 1.</P><!-- \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Link to movie --><!-- #include "goToMovie.incl" #TopicMovie#="OJCLOCK/OJCLK1"#Text#="Play movie"--><A HREF="../../MVHTM/OJCLOCK/OJCLK1.HTM"><IMG SRC="../../STILLS/OJCLOCK/OJCLK1/04JPG03/0.JPG" ALIGN=middle>Play movie</A><!-- end include --><P><B>Figure 1.</B> The orange juice clock set up. Videoof orange juice clock was filmed and edited by Jerry Jacobsen at theUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison. </FONT></P><P>The apparatus was presented in 1987 as part of a teacher workshopled by Irwin Talesnick, then of Queen's University in Canada.Talesnick, whose distinguished career has been characterized byseeing educational possibilities in so many things, created amodified version of the clock, with the atomic numbers of theelements representing the hours in the day (see Fig. 2) in hisinternationally popular workshops. Due largely to Talesnick'sefforts, the orange juice clock is a standard demonstration in manychemistry programs and presentations.</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1123\_2.gif" WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=206 ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 2.</B> Irwin Talesnick represents the hoursof the day by the corresponding elements in his clock.</FONT></P><P><B>The Procedure</B></P><P>This can be done as a demonstration or as an activity, although atabout $10 per clock, expense does become an issue. There are nounusual safety precautions with this demonstration. We know of noaccidents that have occurred with the orange juice clock. Thedemonstration requires:</P><P>a single AA-cell battery-operated wall clock with a sweep-secondhand</P><P>a medium-sized beaker (600 mL is fine)</P><P>enough orange juice or other electrolyte mixture or solution tofill the beaker about 2/3 full (tap water often works fine!)</P><P>a 20-30-cm magnesium strip, coiled at one end or wrapped around apopsicle stick</P><P>a 20-30-cm copper strip, coiled at one end</P><P>alligator clips to connect the strips to the battery terminals onthe clock</P><P>a stand against which to lean the setup</P><P>The demonstration is put together as shown in Figure 3. Connectthe magnesium to the "-" contact of the clock and the copper to the"+" contact. Immerse the other ends of the strips into the solution.The clock will start to tick within a few seconds. If it does notwork within a short period of time, check that the strips are wellconnected to the battery terminals, are hooked to the proper poles,and are not touching each other. The clock should keep reasonablyclose time (in orange juice) for a couple of days, or until themagnesium is nearly completely oxidized.</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1124.gif" ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR><B>Figure 3.</B> A schematic of the orange juice clockseup.</FONT></P><P><!-- \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Link to movie --><!-- #include "goToMovie.incl" #TopicMovie#="OJCLOCK/OJCLK1"#Text#="Play movie"--><A HREF="../../MVHTM/OJCLOCK/OJCLK.HTM"><IMG SRC="../../STILLS/OJCLOCK/OJCLK/04JPG03/0.JPG" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=middle>Play movie</A><!-- end include --><FONT SIZE="-1">Video of orange juice clock.

This response is important because we use itto impress upon students and workshop participants the importance oflooking carefully at the system before giving what might seem like anobvious answer. The copper cannot be reduced because there is nocopper ion in solution, and transition metals cannot be reduced toanions. Given what is actually in solution, participants can concludethat hydrogen ion can be reduced to molecular hydrogen (in orangejuice) or that hydrogen in the water molecule is being reduced tomolecular hydrogen (in hard tap water). In distilled water, the clockdoes not run because the internal resistance of the solution is toohigh, thus forcing the current to be very small. The reactions ofinterest are given as eqs 1-3:</P><P>oxidation: Mg -&gt; Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> + 2e<SUP>-</SUP><I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = 2.37 vs. SHE (1)</P><P>reduction 2H<SUP>+</SUP> + 2e<SUP>-</SUP> -&gt; H<SUB>2</SUB><I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = 0.00 vs. SHE (2)</P><P>(acid solution)</P><P>reduction (water) 2H<SUB>2</SUB>O + 2e<SUP>-</SUP> -&gt;H<SUB>2</SUB> + 2OH<SUP>-</SUP> <I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = -0.8277 vs.SHE (3)</P><P>where <I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = the voltage under standard conditionsand SHE = standard hydrogen electrode.</P><P>At standard conditions, under zero load (all activities equal toone and 298 K) the cell voltage should theoretically be 2.37 V inacid (pH = 1) and about 1.54 V in neutral solution, either of whichis enough to allow the clock to run. It is important to remember theIUPAC convention for electrochemical cells: that voltage of the cellequals voltage of the cathodic half-cell minus voltage of the anodichalf-cell. In this case,</P><P><I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = 0.00 V - (-2.37 V) = 2.37 V</P><P>The standard free energy calculation is straightforward in eachcase (eq 4),</P><P><I><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/delta.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=bottom>G</I><SUP>o</SUP> = -<I>nFE</I><SUP>o</SUP></P><P>in which <I>n</I> = number of moles of electrons transferred, asdictated by the stoichiometry of the reaction (in all reactionsabove, <I>n</I> = 2); <I>F</I> = Faraday's constant, 96,498 C permole of electrons (it is useful to show students that this number isequal to the product of Avogadro's number and electron charge); and<I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = cell voltage under standard conditions(<I>E</I><SUP>o</SUP> = 2.37 V = 2.37 J/C in acid solution of pH =1). In acid solution, <I>DeltaG</I> = -457,000 J = -4.57 kJ. Thereaction is spontaneous (and there is enough current flow). The clockticks.</P><P>This represents an overview of the fundamental chemistry, suitablefor a workshop, high school, or non-science first-year collegeaudience. The discussion below considers some more advanced aspectsof the demonstration, which make this an excellent demonstration forthe first-year science majors' course as well as upper- andgraduate-level analytical and electrochemistry courses.</P><P><B>For Those Who Want More</B></P><P>More advanced students can readily explore the parameters of theclock system beyond merely studying cell voltage at standardconditions. In this system, for example, two sources contribute tothe oxidation of the magnesium electrode. One is the reaction withacid as part of the process that runs the clock. Also present is thereaction in acid solution that occurs irrespective of the electronflow used to run the clock, a process of <I>corrosion that dissolvesthe metal without useful energy being obtained. </I>It is possible todistinguish between the two and to determine, via Faraday's constant,the average current available to the clock in this system.</P><P><I>Faraday's Constant and the Average Current</I></P><P>Data for a typical determination are given in Table 1. The datawere taken using a 0.3317-g magnesium strip that had been cleanedwith steel wool. The magnesium and copper strips (the copper wascleaned by dipping in 1 M nitric acid for a few seconds) were placedin 400 mL of a commercial orange juice so that about 15 cm of eachstrip was above and 15 cm below the liquid line. About 5 cm of themagnesium strip was coiled. The clock was hooked up in the usualfashion. At 1-hour intervals, the mass of the magnesium wire wasdetermined on an analytical balance. A digital multimeter was used tomeasure the voltage every hour and the current every other hour. ThepH of the juice, initially 3.85 at 20 &#176;C, was 3.93 at the end ofthe experiment, as measured with a portable pH meter. This is atypical result. A comparison system (called "no clock" in Table 1)was set up merely by putting a 0.3317-g strip of magnesium in 400 mLof orange juice. With this system we can exemplify a "corrosionprocess" where the anode and the cathode are in the same place. Thereis consumption of magnesium and evolution of molecular hydrogen butno useful current can be obtained. The mass of this magnesium stripwas measured at 1-hour intervals.</P><P>Faraday's constant, which relates coulombs to moles of electrons,can be used to calculate the approximate current available to theclock in this system. The current will not be constant because theH<SUP>+</SUP> concentration (related to pH) is changing and alsobecause the surface area and composition of the magnesium electrodechange with time. The change is not necessarily regular, becausealthough the surface is being oxidized, it is not smooth. The actualavailable surface area will therefore be considerably greater thanthe geometric surface. The mass of magnesium oxidized in the clockreaction over the 4-hour period is approximately equal to the changein grams of magnesium while running the clock minus the mass ofmagnesium oxidized in orange juice without the clock. Using the datafrom Table 1,</P><P>grams Mg oxidized to run clock = approx. (0.3317 - 0.3089)</P><P>- (0.3317 - 0.3136) = 0.0047 g Mg</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1125\_1.gif" ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR></P><P>The average current can then be calculated via Faraday'sconstant:</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1125\_0.gif" ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR></P><P>This is a rather simplistic way to get the current, but it showswell the use of Faraday's constant.</P><P><I>The Value of Computer Interfacing - Exploring the Physics ofCurrent/Voltage Measurements</I></P><P>A more instructive measure of voltage vs. time, which opens up theactivity to more interesting possibilities, was obtained byinterfacing the clock to a Macintosh 8100/80 microcomputer viaVernier Corporation serial box interface hardware and software (seeref <I>2</I>). This affordable ($100-$250 per computer) interfacingpackage is being used in our first-year chemistry laboratories. Theinterfacing setup permitted data to be acquired at the much moremeaningful rate of up to 50 points per second. It also permitted usto observe voltage variations with time while the strips in orangejuice were hooked up to the clock. When data are taken 50 times persecond rather than once every hour, the data take on new meaning.Figure 4 shows that there is a substantial drop in voltage each timethe clock ticks.</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1125\_2.gif" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=250 ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 4.</B> The observed voltage drop in thecircuit corresponds to the ticking of the clock.

A batteryis best used at an intermediate point where the <I>power</I>,<I>I</I> x<I>V</I>, is a maximum. In summary (eqs 5-7):</P><P>(5) Open Circuit: <I>V</I> = maximum and <I>I</I> = 0</P><P>(6) Short Circuit: <I>I</I> = maximum and <I>V</I> = 0</P><P>(7) Battery Use: <I>I</I> x <I>V</I> = power = maximum</P><P>A 1.5-V battery has an open circuit potential of 1.5 volts. Whenthe battery is working, however, the real voltage will be less than1.5 V. This is due to the internal resistance of the battery. So thereal voltage of the battery (<I>V</I><SUB>real</SUB>) equals the opencircuit voltage (<I>V</I><SUB>open</SUB>) minus the voltage drop dueto internal resistance in the battery. This drop is equal to thecurrent passing through the circuit (<I>I</I>) multiplied by theinternal resistance of the battery (<I>R</I><SUB>int</SUB>), as shownin eq 8:</P><P><I>V</I><SUB>real</SUB> = <I>V</I><SUB>open</SUB> - <I>I</I> x<I>R</I><SUB>int</SUB> (8)</P><P>If the current passing is 0.002 A and the internal resistance of a1.5-V battery is 50 Ohms, the real voltage is 1.4 V:</P><P><I>V</I><SUB>real</SUB> = 1.5 V - (0.0020 A x 50 Ohms) = 1.4 V</P><P>In this activity, in which we make a battery with a magnesium anda copper strip in orange juice, <I>the juice itself provides theinternal resistance in the battery.</I> The key then to determiningwhat the voltage drop should be is to find the internal resistance ofthe orange juice and then to find the current passing through theclock circuit.</P><P>Students can determine the internal resistance of the orange juiceby performing the following measurements. Note that the internalresistance of the orange juice is highly dependent upon how far apartthe strips are in solution. The strips should be firmly taped, topand bottom, to the beaker. The data below were typical for 0.35-g Mgand 6.0-g Cu strips that were 4 cm apart in a 600-mL beaker with 400mL of orange juice. The solution was not stirred. The area of thestrips in solution was about 7.5 cm<SUP>2</SUP> for the magnesium andabout 15 cm<SUP>2</SUP> for the copper.</P><P>1. Measure, using a high-impedance voltmeter, the voltage of thecircuit using the voltmeter itself, rather than the clock, tocomplete the circuit. This will give a good approximation of the opencircuit potential (the current is negligible, on the order ofmicroamps if the voltmeter has MOhm resistance). In our setup<I>V</I>open = 1.772 V.</P><P>2. Attach a 1000-Ohm resistor across the circuit. Measure thevoltage in parallel to the resistor. This voltage (1.037 V in oursetup) will be equal to the current in the circuit x the resistanceof 1000 Ohm. We can now solve for the current in this circuit:</P><P><I>I</I> = <I>V</I>/<I>R</I> = 1.037 V/1000 Ohm = 0.001037 A =1.037 mA</P><P>3. The resistance of the orange juice is then calculated via thedifference between the open circuit voltage (1.772 V) and the voltagewith a known resistance (1.037 V). The difference, 1.772 - 1.037 =0.735 V, equals the product of the circuit current and the resistanceof the orange juice (<I>R</I>OJ), or</P><P><I>R</I><SUB>OJ</SUB> = 0.735 V/0.001037 A = 708 Ohm</P><P>4. Finally, measure the current that the clock itself requires byhooking up in series an ammeter to the battery and the clock. Thereading is not easy to take with an ammeter, which does not samplevery often, and integrates across time. The computer interface worksbetter for this. In our clock, a current of 0.49 mA was used.</P><P>5. The payoff comes at this point. The predicted voltage drop(<I>I</I> x <I>R</I><SUB>int</SUB>) can be calculated,</P><P>voltage drop = <I>I</I> x <I>R</I><SUB>int</SUB> = 0.00049 A x 708Ohm = 0.35 V</P><P>Our observed voltage drops for this system were typically around0.30 V. As a confirmation of the relationship of internal resistanceto voltage drop, we placed the strips 1 mm apart in an orange bydigging 2 holes in the orange and placing into the holes the coiledparts of the strips. We expected the voltage drop to be much higherthan with the juice, due to the much higher internal resistance ofthe orange. Even when the strips were nearly touching, the drop wasabout 1 V.</P><P><I>The Water Clock</I></P><P>We discussed above the difference in the redox system when wateris used rather than orange juice. Distilled water, which has a highinternal resistance, will not permit the clock to run. However, hardtap water or distilled water with, for example, 1 g of table salt in300 mL of water will work fine. As expected, because of the lowerhydrogen ion concentration, the initial cell voltage is lower,typically around 1.45 V. The clock also ticks more slowly and moresoftly in water than in orange juice. In water, a black precipitateforms on the magnesium electrode and becomes more extensive withtime. When the strip is removed from distilled water, and allowed todry the precipitate turns white. Further student exploration on theprecipitate might include designing experiments to find out if theprecipitate is a carbonate or an oxide (from the hydroxide.)</P><P><I>Non-Nernstian Considerations</I></P><P>The systems above were always run without stirring because whensetting up demonstrations, portability, simplicity, and expense areimportant, and the main concepts are as clear with a stir bar aswithout. We do note, however, that when the solution is constantlystirred, the rate of magnesium oxidation both with the clock setupand simply in solution is considerably faster than when the processis diffusion-limited. In fact, whereas the Mg strip will often lastfor several days in very dilute acid and overnight in orange juicewhen the solutions are not stirred, it will break off within 4 h whenthe solutions are stirred.</P><P>Another important issue relates to our use of the Nernst equationto account for the potential developed in the system. This equationis very useful to assess chemistry at equilibrium conditions, but theorange juice clock is using an electric current and so is not atequilibrium. In our orange juice system, the Nernst equation (eq 9)is,</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1126.gif" ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR></P><P>in which <I>E</I>&#176; = <I>E</I>&#176;<SUB>Mg</SUB> -<I>E</I>&#176;<SUB>H2</SUB> - h</P><P>and h = overpotential = difference in H<SUB>2</SUB>/H<SUP>+</SUP>couple at a copper electrode minus that at platinum black. Thehydrogen overpotential on a copper surface is typically 0.23 V.Another treatment of overpotential is given below.</P><P>In our experiments, magnesium concentration and hydrogen activitywere not measured or controlled; the pH was 3.85-3.93, as describedabove.</P><P>The maximum theoretical potential of the electrode system isgreater than that which is available to the clock when there iscurrent flow. As described above, the potential drop is calculated ascurrent &#165; internal resistance, equaling the "<I>iR</I> drop."This is why potentials are measured with a voltmeter, with a veryhigh internal resistance, which draws very little current from thesystem.</P><P>The measure of how far a system is from equilibrium is called the<I>overpotential</I> (h)</P><P>h = actual potential minus potential at equilibrium</P><P>This, along with the anodic and the cathodic components, theenergy involved, and the temperature of the system are all dealt withusing the Butler-Volmer equation, given as eq 10:</P><P><I>I</I> =<I>i</I><SUB>o</SUB>(<I>e</I><SUP>+</SUP><I><SUP>F</SUP></I><SUP>h/2</SUP><I><SUP>RT</SUP></I>-<I>e</I><SUP>-</SUP><I><SUP>F</SUP></I><SUP>h/2</SUP><I><SUP>RT</SUP></I>)(10)</P><P>in which <I>i</I><SUB>o</SUB> is a specific constant for everysystem "electrode-electrolyte" and is called the "equilibriumexchange current." For this case, we have assumed the symmetry factorto be equal to 1/2. A detailed discussion of this factor is beyondthe purpose of this paper, but can be found in ref <I>3</I>.</P><P><B>Questions To Raise with Students/Teacher WorkshopParticipants</B></P><P>This demonstration can be a starting point for many concepts. Itis especially powerful in showing how chemistry can be used beyondthe chemistry laboratory. The primary question is "how is this systemdifferent from that in which redox occurs at one surface (such as azinc strip placed in a solution of copper sulfate)?" The key withthis electrochemical cell is that we are separating the anode fromthe cathode to take advantage of the electron flow (current) throughan external wire and this current will give power to the clock or anyother device. This is the essence of a battery. Other questions weoften ask are:</P><P>Is enough current produced to run a small electric motor? Light alight?</P><P>Would the system work if we put Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> ions into thesolution?</P><P>What would happen if we titrate the acid solution with a strongbase while the clock is running?</P><P>What happens to the voltage if we put Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> into thesystem?</P><P>Are the complex ions of Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> with citric acid importantto the potential value?</P><P>What is the relationship between the clock ticking and differentjuices? Why is this relationship so?</P><P>What are the reactions in the most popular commercialbatteries?</P><P>What is the chemical basis of rechargeable batteries?</P><P><B>Related Activities </B></P><P>We do this demonstration while studying electrochemistry duringthe second semester of the general chemistry sequence. In precollegeteacher workshops, it is an important focus of an Operation Chemistryunit dealing with energy needs for living on board the space shuttle(<I>4</I>). A number of fairly safe activities work well as lead-inor follow-up material, as described in Table 2. Copies of theseactivities are available by writing to PK.</P><P><IMG SRC="GRAPHICO/1127.gif" ALIGN=bottom hspace=100 vspace=10><BR></P><P><B>Acknowledgments</B></P><P>We wish to thank Walt Hancock and Jonathan Skean, along with ourwonderful undergraduates Mickey Richards, Cory Emal, Julie Grundman,Jeff Atkins, and Darren Jack, for being there.</P><P><B>Literature Cited</B></P><P>1.
