The pale yellow color of the white phosphorus can be clearly seen on the paper as the writing is done. As the solvent carbon disulfide evaporates away, the phosphorus begins to react with oxygen from the air. This spontaneous combustion reaction is an exothermic one that causes the paper to char, leaving P

When exposed to air in the dark it glows with greenish light, 
a phenomenon known as phosphorescence. 
In moist air, white phosphorus ignites spontaneously at 30

>  C. 
The ignition temperature is higher in dry air. 
White phosphorus is extremely dangerous and toxic-much more so than the black and red allotropes.
