>  Copper turnings heated to glowing red react vigorously with chlorine gas in a flask. The product is solid copper(II) chloride. Evidence for this product is the fact that when it is dissolved in water a blue-green solution results. This is characteristic of copper(II) ions in aqueous solution.

>  Copper turnings are heated and placed in a flask containing chlorine gas. The copper reacts vigorously with the chlorine to form a cloud of copper(II) chloride. When the flask is rinsed with water the copper(II) chloride dissolves forming a blue-green solution.

>  Copper and chlorine do not react rapidly at room temperature, but if the copper is heated, the reaction is vigorous. Two products are possible, copper(I) chloride and copper(II) chloride. The copper is seen to be oxidized all the way to copper(II) chloride because the product, when dissolved in water, has the blue-green color characteristic of aqueous copper(II) chloride. Copper(I) chloride is colorless.
