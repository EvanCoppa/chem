>  Two "lead" pencil electrodes connected to a small battery are dipped into a variety of solutions. When the apparatus is dipped into solutions of HCl, NaOH and NaCl, bubbles are observed at each of the electrodes, and an indicator is used to test the acidity near each of the electrodes. When the apparatus is dipped in distilled water, no reaction is observed. The electrodes are then dipped into a variety of metal nitrate solutions. In every case, oxygen is generated at the anode. In some cases hydrogen is produced at the cathode, while in others metal deposits form. In a few cases, both gas bubbles and solid deposits are observed. The reactions at the cathode correlate pretty well with the reduction potentials of the metal ions.

>  With the exception of aqueous NaOH, the half-reaction producing oxygen at the anode (the electrode at the left) is that shown in the still images for the NaCl solution (see above). Similarly, the half-reaction for the production of hydrogen at the cathode is that shown for aqueous NaCl, with the exception of the HCl solution.

Classify each metal as reactive (no metal produced), moderately reactive (metal and hydrogen produced) or unreactive (only metal produced). How well does your classification scheme match the values of the reduction potentials of the metal ions? Are there any discrepancies?
