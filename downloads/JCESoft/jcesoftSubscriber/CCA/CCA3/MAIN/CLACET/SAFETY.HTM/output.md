>  Chlorine gas is poisonous and a very strong irritant. Inhalation of chlorine should be avoided, so proper ventilation is necessary. Acetylene gas is a major explosion hazard and is an asphyxiant. Trace quantities of phosphine may be generated along with acetylene from calcium carbide and water. Phosphine is poisonous and inflames sponteaneously in air. Hydrogen chloride produced by the reaction of acetylene with chlorine can irritate or burn mucous membranes.
