>  Zinc metal reacts with hydrochloric acid, generating hydrogen gas.However, when a strip of nickel, copper, platinum or lead is placedin hydrochloric acid, no reaction is observed. When nickel dipped inhydrochloric acid is brought in contact with zinc, bubbles form onthe surface of the nickel metal. Hydrogen also forms on the surfaces ofcopper and platinum when those metals touch the zinc. When nickel,copper or platinum is connected electrically to the zinc externally (through a wire), bubbles againform on the surface of each of these metals. However, when a piece oflead is brought in contact with the zinc, no bubbles are observed onthe surface of the lead.

No gas isgenerated at the lead strip when the metals are separated in thesolution but connected by an external wire, since lead's overvoltageis higher than zinc's overvoltage.

>  More puzzling is the fact that when nickel, copper or platinum is placed in contact with zinc, bubbles form on the other metal's surface. Zinc is still being oxidized to Zn

>  to form hydrogen gas. Reduction of hydrogen ions at the metal surface is most favored when metal-hydrogen bonds are of intermediate strength so that the hydrogen will be weakly bound to the metal during electron transfer, but not so strongly bound as to prevent the formation and escape of H

>  (see Figure 1). This model accounts for the vigorous bubbling on platinum (the least reactive of the metals in this demonstration), moderate bubbling on nickel and copper, and for the absence of bubble formation on lead.
