>  Iron wool heated to glowing red reacts vigorously with chlorine gas in a flask. The product is red-brown solid iron(III) chloride. Evidence for this product is the fact that when it is dissolved in water a yellow-orange solution results. This is characteristic of iron(III) ions in aqueous solution.

>  A ball of iron wool is heated and placed in a flask containing chlorine gas. The iron reacts vigorously with the chlorine to form a cloud of iron(III) chloride. After several minutes the iron(III) chloride formed by the reaction settles to the bottom of the flask. When the flask is rinsed with water the iron(III) chloride dissolves forming an orange solution.

>  Iron and chlorine do not react rapidly at room temperature, but if the iron is heated, the reaction is vigorous. Two products are possible, iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride. The iron is seen to be oxidized all the way to iron(III) chloride because the product is rust colored and when dissolved in water has the yellow-orange color characteristic of aqueous iron(III) ions. This color is actually due to the monohydroxo complex of iron(III) ion. Hexaaquoiron(III) ion is sufficiently acidic that it loses one proton unless the solution has been acidified with a stronger acid.
