>  Hydrogen gas flowing from a capillary is ignited. The watch glass covering a glass cylinder of chlorine is removed and the hydrogen flame lowered into the chlorine. The reaction between hydrogen and air is replaced by the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine, which produces hydrogen chloride. As the flame burns the level of chlorine gas in the container decreases. When a stopper from a bottle of aqueous ammonia is brought near the flame, white fumes of ammonium chloride are produced indicating the presence of hydrogen chloride.
