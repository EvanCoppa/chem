>  Silver nitrate solution is poured into a dish containing a pieceof filter paper. When sodium chloride solution is added, the paperbecomes coated with a layer of solid silver chloride. The paper ismoved to another dish, and a key is placed on top of it. When thepaper is exposed to the light from a burning magnesium ribbon, thepaper darkens due to photodecomposition of the silver chloride, whichproduces silver metal. Removing the key reveals its image on thepaper.
