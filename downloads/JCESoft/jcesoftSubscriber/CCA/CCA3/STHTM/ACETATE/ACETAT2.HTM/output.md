>  The probe from a digital thermometer touches the solidsodium acetate to test the temperature. It is seen that thematerial is quite warm. The process of crystallization is anexothermic process in which heat is given off to the surroundings.The crystallization occurred rapidly once a seed crystal wasavailable. The seed crystal provides a structure around which theions of sodium acetate could form a solid crystal lattice.
