>  Two burners are ignited below the copper coil. These burners heat the steam to a very high temperature. The steam still condenses to liquid water in a beaker. A match placed into the superheated steam ignites. When steel wool is placed in the superheated steam, the steel wool glows brightly and reacts with the steam. Reaction with superheated steam can cause metal pipes in electric power plants to corrode and wear out.
