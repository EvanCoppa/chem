>  Concentrated sulfuric acid is added to table sugar, sucrose, which had previously been mixed with water. The sulfuric acid dehydrates the sugar, a carbohydrate. The sugar turns brown due to the removal of water in this caramelization process. The remaining black solid contains mostly carbon. Steam generated in this exothermic process causes the solid mass to expand.

>  Sulfuric acid also acts as an oxidizing agent, and is reduced to sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide reduces dissolved purple permanganate to nearly colorless manganese(II).
