>  This animation simulates the electrolysis of a neutral aqueous solution, such as sodium sulfate. At the anode, water molecules produce oxygen gas, hydrogen ions, and electrons. The electrons flow through the circuit to the cathode, where they react with water to produce hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions. If the solution is stirred, acid-base neutralization will occur.
