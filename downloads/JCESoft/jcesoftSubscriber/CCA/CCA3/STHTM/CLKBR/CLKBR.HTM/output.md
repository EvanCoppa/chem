>  A test tube contains a layer of potassium bromide solution over a denser layer of carbon tetrachloride. Chlorine is bubbled through the potassium bromide layer. The chlorine reacts with the bromide to form bromine. The aqueous layer contains a mixture of bromine, bromide ion and tribromide ion. Bromine is also dissolved in the carbon tetrachloride layer to form a reddish solution. The bromide and tribromide ions do not dissolve in the carbon tetrachloride and remain in the aqueous layer. Some bromine gas can be seen above the aqueous layer. After some time the stream of chlorine has swept all of the bromine from the aqueous solution into the gas phase.Some bromine remains in the carbon tetrachloride layer.
