>  Two lead electrodes are placed in a beaker of sulfuric acid solution. When the two electrodes are connected to the leads of a motor, the motor does not run, since no chemical reaction is occurring in the beaker to provide electrical energy.

>  When the two electrodes are connected to a power supply, the electricity causes chemical reactions to occur at the electrodes. At one electrode, hydrogen gas is generated, while at the other electrode, oxygen gas is produced, and a lead(IV) oxide coating forms on the surface of the metal.

>  Now when the electrodes are connected to a motor, the motor runs, because a chemical reaction occurs within the beaker. Lead(IV) oxide is reduced to lead(II) sulfate at one electrode, and lead metal is oxidized to lead(II) sulfate at the other. These are the same chemical reactions that provide electrical energy in a lead storage battery.
