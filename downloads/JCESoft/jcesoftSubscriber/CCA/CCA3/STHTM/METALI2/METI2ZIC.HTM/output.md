>  A zinc strip is placed in a zinc sulfate solution. Iodine and potassium iodide are mixed in a porous cup. Placing the cup in the zinc solution, putting a graphite electrode connected to a motor in the solution, and connecting the zinc metal to the other side of the motor completes the circuit, allowing electricity to flow and driving the motor.
