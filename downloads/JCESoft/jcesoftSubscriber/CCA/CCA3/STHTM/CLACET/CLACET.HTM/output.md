>  Chips of calcium carbide are placed on a watch glass inside a cylinder of chlorine. Water is slowly dripped onto the calcium carbide generating acetylene gas. The acetylene reacts rapidly with the chlorine producing clouds of carbon. When a stopper from a bottle of aqueous ammonia is brought near the flame, white fumes of ammonium chloride are produced indicating the presence of hydrogen chloride. Although acetylene continues to be generated, the reaction with chlorine ceases when all of the chlorine has been consumed.
