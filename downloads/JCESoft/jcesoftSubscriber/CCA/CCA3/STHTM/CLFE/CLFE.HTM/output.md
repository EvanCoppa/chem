>  A ball of iron wool is heated and placed in a flask containing chlorine gas. The iron reacts vigorously with the chlorine to form a cloud of iron(III) chloride. After several minutes the iron(III) chloride formed by the reaction settles to the bottom of the flask. When the flask is rinsed with water the iron(III) chloride dissolves forming an orange solution.
