>  A solution of malonic acid, starch and manganese(II) catalyst is added to a solution of hydrogen peroxide, iodate, and sulfuric acid. A reaction involving many steps occurs. One step generates iodine, oxygen gas, and carbon dioxide gas. When the concentration of iodine gets large enough, triiodide is generated and forms a blue complex with starch. A second step uses up iodine, reversing the formation of the blue complex. As the iodine concentration oscillates, the color oscillates from colorless to amber to blue.
