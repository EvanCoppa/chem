>  Pieces of aluminum are cut from a strip of foil. Liquid bromine is placed on a watch glass and the pieces of aluminum are added. As the bromine evaporates, brown fumes are given off. At first there is no reaction because of the protective oxide coating on the aluminum. An exothermic reaction between bromine and aluminum causes more brown fumes of bromine to be given off. White fumes are also given off. When a fan is turned on, we can better observe the residue, which consists of aluminum bromide, excess bromine and aluminum. The brown color is caused by the excess bromine.
