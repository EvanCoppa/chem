>  Natural gas flowing from a capillary is ignited. The watch glass covering a glass cylinder of chlorine is removed and the methane flame lowered. The reaction between methane and air is replaced by the reaction between methane and chlorine, which produces carbon, hydrogen chloride and various chlorocarbons. As the flame burns the level of chlorine gas in the container decreases. When a stopper from a bottle of aqueous ammonia is brought near the flame, white fumes of ammonium chloride are produced indicating the presence of hydrogen chloride.
