>  Granular zinc is mixed with iodine and there is no reaction whenthe two dry solids are mixed together. When water is added to thismixture, there is a reaction approximately as vigorous as thereaction of the manganese with the iodine, showing that zinc andmanganese are roughly equivalent in reducing strength, and arestronger than iron and nickel, but not quite as strong as aluminum.
