>  Ammonium thiocyanate is mixed with barium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred and the two solids react. A slush is formed because water is one of the products of the reaction. A drop of water is placed on a block of wood and the beaker is placed on the water drop. The reaction is endothermic, that is, it takes in heat. As a result, the bottom of the beaker becomes cold enough to freeze the water and stick to the wood.
