>  A few drops of glycerin are placed into a hollow in a pile of potassium permanganate. Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent and glycerin is an easily oxidized substance. Consequently a redox type reaction is expected between these two substances. An exothermic reaction does occur with the glycerin boiling giving off smoke and eventually producing a flame that spreads around the pile of potassium permanganate. Eventually all the glycerin is consumed by the permanganate.
