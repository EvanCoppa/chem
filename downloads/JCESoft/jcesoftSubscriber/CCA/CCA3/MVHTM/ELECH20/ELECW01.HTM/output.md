>  Two cylinders containing a sodium sulfate solution are connected with tubing. Each has a platinum electrode connected to a power supply. Bromthymol Blue indicator is in the sodium sulfate solution. The top vial shows the indicator color in the acid, the middle in neutral solution, and the bottom in base.When electricity passes through the system, oxidation occurs at one electrode and reduction at the other. Gas is formed at each electrode, and the acidity increases at one electrode and decreases at the other.
