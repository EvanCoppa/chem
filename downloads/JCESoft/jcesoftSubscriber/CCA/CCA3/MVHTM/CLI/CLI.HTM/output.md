>  Iodine crystals are placed at the bottom of a capillary tube. Chlorine gas is passed through the iodine crystals. The initial reaction between the chlorine and iodine forms iodine monochloride. The brown vapor of iodine monochloride can be seen flowing from the capillary. Dark brown iodine monochloride liquid is collected at the bottom of the test tube. As more chlorine is added, the brown iodine monochloride forms crystals of yellow iodine trichloride.
