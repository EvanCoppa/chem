>  Because of its high reactivity, potassium metal is stored in mineral oil, a relatively inert liquid. The protective coating of mineral oil must be removed from the metal's surface. The soft potassium will then be cut, and a small piece will be picked up with forceps and carefully added to a small beaker of liquid bromine. The large covered beaker prevents the escape of bromine vapor and reaction products into the environment.
