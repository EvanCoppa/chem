>  A buffered luminol solution with a copper(II) catalyst is added tothe funnel on the left. A hydrogen peroxide solution is added to thefunnel on the right. On releasing the rubber tubing the solutionsmix. The chemical reaction generates energy which is seen as bluelight. This process is chemiluminescence. When the reactingsolution mixes with a dye, fluorescein, the light energy from thereaction causes the fluorescein to give off a greenish light in aprocess called fluorescence.
