>  Commercially available light sticks contain a solution in a glass vial. When the vial is broken, a second solution mixes with the first and light is generated.Different dyes give off different colors when they are caused to fluoresce by the lightof the chemiluminescent reaction. Light sticks give off light from 3to 8 hours, depending on the concentrations of reactants.
