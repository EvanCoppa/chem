>  Powdered aluminum and powdered iodine are mixed together and then one or two drops of water are added to the mixture. Shortly after the water is added, a vigorous reaction occurs. There is flame and lots of iodine vapor given off. Some of the iodine vapor can be seen to be reacting to form some other substance because the color is no longer violet but kind of a reddish brown. This vigorous reaction shows that aluminum metal is a fairly strong reducing agent and iodine solid is a fairly strong oxidizing agent.
