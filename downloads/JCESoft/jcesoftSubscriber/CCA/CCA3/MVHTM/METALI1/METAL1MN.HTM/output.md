>  Manganese is mixed with iodine. Notice that the powdered manganeseis black, and the iodine is also nearly black. Again there is noreaction just upon mixing the solid materials but as soon as a fewdrops of water are added, a reaction does take place. Again thereaction is vigorous, but this time there is no flame. By comparisonwith the aluminum reaction, the manganese reaction was not asvigorous.
