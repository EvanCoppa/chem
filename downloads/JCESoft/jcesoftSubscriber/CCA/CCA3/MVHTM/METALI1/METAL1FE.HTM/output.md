>  Powdered iron is mixed with some iodine. There is no reaction whenthe dry solids are mixed together. In this case, adding waterinitiates a reaction but it is not as vigorous as the reaction of thealuminum or the manganese. Apparently iron is not as strong areducing agent as these other metals relative to iodine.
