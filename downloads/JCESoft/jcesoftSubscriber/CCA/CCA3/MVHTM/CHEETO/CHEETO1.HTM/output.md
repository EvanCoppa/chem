>  Items of food contain considerable energy. Under appropriate conditions this energy can be released much more rapidly than it is in your body. To release the energy rapidly, a sample of potassium chlorate is melted with a burner and a piece of food is dropped into the molten potassium chlorate. The food reacts fairly violently in an exothermic process that releases considerable energy.
