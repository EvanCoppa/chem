>  Here is a Cheeto. According to the nutrition information on the package, 21 Cheetos provide 150 nutritional Calories. One nutritional Calorie is one kilocalorie, so each Cheeto can release about seven kilocalories or 30 kJ of energy. When a Cheeto is placed into liquid potassium chlorate the vigorous, highly exothermic reaction releases about 30 kJ.
