>  Concentrated sulfuric acid is added to table sugar, sucrose, whichhad previously been mixed with water. The sulfuric acid dehydratesthe sugar, a carbohydrate. The sugar turns brown due to the removalof water in this caramelization process. The remaining black solidcontains mostly carbon. Steam generated in this exothermic processcauses the solid mass to expand.

>  Sulfuric acid also acts as an oxidizing agent, and is reduced tosulfur dioxide. A rose petal is bleached by the sulfur dioxide.
