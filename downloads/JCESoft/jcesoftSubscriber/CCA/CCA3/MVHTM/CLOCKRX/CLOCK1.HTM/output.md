>  A solution of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid is added to a solution of iodide ion, thiosulfate ion, and starch. A slow reaction forms triiodide, which reacts rapidly with thiosulfate, until the thiosulfate is consumed. The excess triiodide then reacts with the starch to form a blue complex.
