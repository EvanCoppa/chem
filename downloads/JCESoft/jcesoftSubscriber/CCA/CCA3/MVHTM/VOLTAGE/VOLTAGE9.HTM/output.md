>  A zinc strip placed in hydrochloric acid generates gas bubbles,but a lead strip in the same solution does not. When the two metalstouch, still no bubbles are generated at the lead strip. No gas isgenerated at the lead strip when the metals are separated in thesolution but connected by an external wire, since lead's overvoltageis higher than zinc's overvoltage.
