>  A zinc strip placed in hydrochloric acid generates gas bubbles,but a copper strip in the same solution does not. When the two metalstouch, gas is also generated at the copper strip. When a wire isplaced across the two metal strips outside the solution, with thestrips not touching inside the solution, again gas is generated atthe copper strip.
