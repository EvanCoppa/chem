>  When nitrogen triodide detonates, the products are explosively produced and distributed.The process is shown in reverse. The products of the explosion ofnitrogen triiodide "assemble themselves" to form the original system asit was before the explosion. The situation shown is sohighly improbable that we would not expect to observe it innature.
