>  When purple permanganate solution is poured into sulfur dioxide, the permanganate is reduced to nearly colorless manganese(II) ions, and the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfate ion. When dichromate solution is added to this colorless solution, the sulfur dioxide reduces the yellow dichromate to green chromium(III) ion, while the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfate ion.
