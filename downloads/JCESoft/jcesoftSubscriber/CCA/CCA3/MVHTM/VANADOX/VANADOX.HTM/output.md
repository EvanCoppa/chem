>  A yellow solution of vanadium in its plus five oxidation state is poured into a large flask containing a zinc amalgam. The zinc serves as a reducing agent for the vanadium species. In the process, the zinc is oxidized to zinc(II) ion. When the flask is swirled, the vanadium changes to a light blue, indicating a plus four oxidation state. Swirling increases the contact between the zinc amalgam and the aqueous vanadium solution. Further reduction produces a deep green vanadium plus three solution. With even more swirling in the amalgam, the vanadium is ultimately transformed to purple vanadium plus two.
