>  Now a commercial application of this crystallization process isshown. A metal disc is manipulated inside a sealed plastic bagholding the sodium acetate solution. This causes the sodiumacetate to crystallize. The digital thermometer shows that thetemperature of the heating pack has gone up significantly fromroom temperature. This heating pack provides an easily portablemethod of having heat available whenever and wherever it isneeded.
