>  A solution of sodium acetate in water is in a flask. A fewsmall crystals of sodium acetate are placed on the top of thelaboratory bench. The solution from the flask is poured over thecrystals. As the solution contacts the crystals, its color changesfrom clear to white very rapidly and it crystallizes into a solidmound of material that builds up into a fairly tall verticalstructure.
