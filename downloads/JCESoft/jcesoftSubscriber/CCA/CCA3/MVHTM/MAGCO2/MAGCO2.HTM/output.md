>  Magnesium is placed in a cavity in a block of dry ice. Themagnesium is ignited and covered by another block of dry ice. Despite the absence of air, the magnesium continues to glow, due toits reaction with carbon dioxide. Because of this reaction, carbondioxide cannot be used to extinguish magnesium fires.
